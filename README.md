# VSD Risc V Tapeout

Week 0:
The introductory lecture talks about the entire process of building a chip starting from checking the specifications at different levels of abstraction and then finally giving it to the fab (tapeout). Once the specs have been tested, the simulation of the requirements are written in hardware description languages like Verilog. Furthermore, processor and peripheral parts are designed with an emphasis on them being synthesizable. Before sending to the fab, DRC checks are done, and after some duration (around 3-4 months), the fab returns the chip (tape-in) so that other peripheral elements can be added.
